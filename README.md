# Red Wine Quality Assessment

This project focuses on assessing the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and covers several key steps in the data science workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and model fine-tuning.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the quality of red wine. The dataset used in this analysis consists of several input variables that describe the chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, etc., and an output variable that represents wine quality.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is first preprocessed using the MinMax Scaler method to normalize the features, making it suitable for machine learning models.
- **Mean Shift Train Model:** A Mean Shift clustering algorithm is applied to train the model on the processed data.
- **Fine-Tuning Model:** The model is then fine-tuned to improve its prediction accuracy on unseen data.

## How to Use

To run this analysis, you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your computer. You can open the `Red Wine Quality Assessment.ipynb` file in Jupyter to view the analysis and run the cells to replicate the results.
